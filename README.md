This is a sample Unity project done in about 25 working hours. It closely mimics the looks, sounds & game play of the original classic game released on ZX Spectrum in 1983.

The game is operated with the arrow keys and the return key. Additionally you can use cheat-keys to progress through the game quickly. The U/D keys snap the player character up & down the floors when it's in normal walking state. The N key force-ends the level.

What's done:
 - the gameplay levels mimic quite precisely the original
 - graphics, animations and sounds are taken from the simulated version provided
 - care was taken to math the behavior, timing, and feel of the original gameplay

What's not done:
 - intermission and game over screens are just place holders, and they don't display any story text, or score/level information
 - positioning of floor gaps & hazards is done by simple randomization, no gameplay tweaking was done
 - source code has not been cleaned up in any way

Below is a screenshot from the game.
